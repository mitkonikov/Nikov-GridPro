# Nikov-GridPro
A C# Apps for Grid Generation, currently just the prototype is available

Currently working on transferring the prototype into a WPF Application.

# Features:
- Create a grid
--- customisable stroke width, size of the squares, offset
- Put shapes [currently circle, you can change it in the code] on the intersects
- Shape glow effect

# TO DO:
- Transfer the current code to WPF [High Priority]
- Putting images inside the squares or on the intersects
- More shapes without coding
- Setting the resolution of the picture from outside

When I submit the WPF App, you can fork it, modify it and submit it again,
I'll review the code and make the changes. Thanks!
